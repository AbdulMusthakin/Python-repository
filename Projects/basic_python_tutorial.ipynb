There is nothing here that is really advanced as the purpose of this is to be the essentials of Python. I hope that anyone reading this notebook will be able to learn the basics of Python which they can then apply to learn further or use the information in their own projects. "

    "## 1. Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several in-depth data types that are used to do different things as well as represent different kind of values. This tutorial will only cover the the basic data types that you have to know to get started with Python. These are numbers (ints, floats), strings and booleans. There are a few other data types that will be covered in this tutorial along with the other topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of numbers in Python: ints and floats. Ints or integers are whole numbers and floats are numbers with a decimal point. You can do basic calculations with these numbers by themselves or assigning them to variables. Below you can see that we have assigned the number 1 to the variable 'x'. We have also given two examples of floats. You can see that there is a decimal point seperating the number. Floats may represent whole numbers (e.g. 1.0), as long as there is a decimal point. Both floats and ints can be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "    x = 1 # int\n",
    "    x = -5 # int\n",
    "    y = 1.0 # float\n",
    "    z = -414.7 # float\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are a sequence of characters. It can be anything inside two quotation marks. You can use single or double quotes to represent a string, it does not matter. Strings are quite simple are used to output text. You can also use triple quotes to represent a string which is useful if you want it to span multiple lines. Below are some examples of strings. On the first one, the words 'Hello World' are inside single quotes. The first and second example are equiavalent. On the third example, everything between the two triple quotes count as one string.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "    x = 'Hello World' # string\n",
    "    y = \"Hello World\" # string with double quotes, which I will use for the rest of the tutorial\n",
    "    z = \"\"\"\n",
    "    Hello,\n",
    "    I like\n",
    "    turtles.\n",
    "    \"\"\" # multi-line string\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans are a data type that can only be True or False. They represent logical values and can be used in conditional statements i.e. to check if something is true or false. You can also think of True as being 1 and False as being 0. Below are two examples of booleans. Make sure that you capitalise the first letter of True and False.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "    x = True # boolean\n",
    "    y = False # boolean\n",

    "## 2. Output\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Using print()\n",
    "\n",
    "Output is the process of displaying information to the user. This is a very important part of Python and is used in practically all programs. The main way of outputting data is by using the print() function (more on functions later). The print() function takes in a string or a variable (will talk about this in a bit), and outputs it to the user through a terminal / console. Below are some examples of outputting or printing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello World\") # prints the words 'Hello World'\n",
    "    print(x) # prints the value of x, a variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Outputting multiple values\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to output multiple things in Python. First, you could just use multiple print() functions. This is the most basic way of doing it. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\")\n",
    "    print(\"World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hello\n",
    "    World\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem with this is that the two strings are on different lines, which you may not want. There are ways of changing this but that is outside of the scope of this tutorial. A second way of outputting multiple things is with the + operator. This can be used to add or concatenate (just the technical name) two strings together. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\" + \"World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    HelloWorld\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem you can see here is that there is no space between the two words. This is because the + operator does not add spaces between strings. A solution is to have a string with just a single space added in between the two words. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\" + \" \" + \"World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hello World\n",
    "\n",
    "That seems annoying to do, especially if you have a lot of strings to add together. A easier way way of doing the same thing is to using a comma. This is the way I prefer to do it. Below is an example of this which returns the same output as the code above.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\", \"World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Try using the interactive code cells below to print somethings out. You can also try printing out multiple things at once."

    "## 3. Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Assigning variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are used to store data. You can then use this data later on in the program without having to type it all out. Variables are very useful and I cannot think of any program I've written or see that does not use them. Variables are assigned a value using the = operator. Another thing to note is that they are assigned the data type of the value you assign them to. Below are some examples of variables.\n",

    "    x = 1 # int\n",

    "    z = \"Hello World\" # string\n",
    "    a = True # boolean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Accessing variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To access variables, you can output them with print(). Just put the variable name inside the brackets. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    x = 1\n",
    "    print(x) # prints 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to have a variable be alongside something else in print(). You could do this with the + operater or a comma. You have to make sure when using + because if the two things are not the same data type or are a data type that can't be added, you will get an error. This won't happen with a comma. Below are some examples of accessing variables with print().\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    x = 1\n",
    "    y = 2\n",
    "    print(x + y) # prints 3\n",
    "    print(x, y) # prints 1 2\n",
    "    name = \"Bob\"\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\", name) # prints Hello Bob\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\" + name) # prints HelloBob\n",
    "    print (\"Hello\" + 5) # Returns TypeError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Naming variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You can name your variables most things. Some things which you can't do are:\n",
    "* Name a variable the same as a keyword (e.g. if, while, for)\n",
    "* Name a variable the same as a data type (e.g. int, float, string)\n",
    "* Name a variable the same as a function (e.g. print, input)\n",
    "* Start a variable name with a number\n",
    "* Use spaces in a variable name\n",
    "* Use special symbols in a variable name (e.g. !, @, #)\n",
    "* Use underscores at the start of a variable name (e.g. _x). You can use them in the middle or end of a variable name (e.g. x_, x_y, x_y_z)\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of valid and invalid variable names are below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1 # valid\n",
    "134 = 1 # invalid\n",
    "x_ = 1 # valid\n",
    "_x = 1 # invalid\n",
    "x y = 1 # invalid\n",
    "x-y = 1 # invalid\n",
    "dhaduafvaf = 1 # valid\n",
    "*&$^%$^%$^% = 1 # invalid\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, you can do many things with variables and they are essential for practically every piece of code. There are a lot of more advanced things with variables that can be done in Python which may be covered in another tutorial."
