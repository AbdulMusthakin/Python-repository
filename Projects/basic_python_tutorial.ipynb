    "## 1. Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several in-depth data types that are used to do different things as well as represent different kind of values. This tutorial will only cover the the basic data types that you have to know to get started with Python. These are numbers (ints, floats), strings and booleans. There are a few other data types that will be covered in this tutorial along with the other topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of numbers in Python: ints and floats. Ints or integers are whole numbers and floats are numbers with a decimal point. You can do basic calculations with these numbers by themselves or assigning them to variables. Below you can see that we have assigned the number 1 to the variable 'x'. We have also given two examples of floats. You can see that there is a decimal point seperating the number. Floats may represent whole numbers (e.g. 1.0), as long as there is a decimal point. Both floats and ints can be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "    x = 1 # int\n",
    "    x = -5 # int\n",
    "    y = 1.0 # float\n",
    "    z = -414.7 # float\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are a sequence of characters. It can be anything inside two quotation marks. You can use single or double quotes to represent a string, it does not matter. Strings are quite simple are used to output text. You can also use triple quotes to represent a string which is useful if you want it to span multiple lines. Below are some examples of strings. On the first one, the words 'Hello World' are inside single quotes. The first and second example are equiavalent. On the third example, everything between the two triple quotes count as one string.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "    x = 'Hello World' # string\n",
    "    y = \"Hello World\" # string with double quotes, which I will use for the rest of the tutorial\n",
    "    z = \"\"\"\n",
    "    Hello,\n",
    "    I like\n",
    "    turtles.\n",
    "    \"\"\" # multi-line string\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans are a data type that can only be True or False. They represent logical values and can be used in conditional statements i.e. to check if something is true or false. You can also think of True as being 1 and False as being 0. Below are two examples of booleans. Make sure that you capitalise the first letter of True and False.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "    x = True # boolean\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Using print()\n",
    "\n",
    "Output is the process of displaying information to the user. This is a very important part of Python and is used in practically all programs. The main way of outputting data is by using the print() function (more on functions later). The print() function takes in a string or a variable (will talk about this in a bit), and outputs it to the user through a terminal / console. Below are some examples of outputting or printing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello World\") # prints the words 'Hello World'\n",
    "    print(x) # prints the value of x, a variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Outputting multiple values\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to output multiple things in Python. First, you could just use multiple print() functions. This is the most basic way of doing it. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\")\n",
    "    print(\"World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hello\n",
    "    World\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem with this is that the two strings are on different lines, which you may not want. There are ways of changing this but that is outside of the scope of this tutorial. A second way of outputting multiple things is with the + operator. This can be used to add or concatenate (just the technical name) two strings together. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\" + \"World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    HelloWorld\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem you can see here is that there is no space between the two words. This is because the + operator does not add spaces between strings. A solution is to have a string with just a single space added in between the two words. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\" + \" \" + \"World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hello World\n",
    "\n",
    "That seems annoying to do, especially if you have a lot of strings to add together. A easier way way of doing the same thing is to using a comma. This is the way I prefer to do it. Below is an example of this which returns the same output as the code above.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\", \"World\")\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Assigning variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are used to store data. You can then use this data later on in the program without having to type it all out. Variables are very useful and I cannot think of any program I've written or see that does not use them. Variables are assigned a value using the = operator. Another thing to note is that they are assigned the data type of the value you assign them to. Below are some examples of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    x = 1 # int\n",
    "    y = 1.0 # float\n",
    "    z = \"Hello World\" # string\n",
    "    a = True # boolean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Accessing variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To access variables, you can output them with print(). Just put the variable name inside the brackets. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    x = 1\n",
    "    print(x) # prints 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to have a variable be alongside something else in print(). You could do this with the + operater or a comma. You have to make sure when using + because if the two things are not the same data type or are a data type that can't be added, you will get an error. This won't happen with a comma. Below are some examples of accessing variables with print().\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    x = 1\n",
    "    y = 2\n",
    "    print(x + y) # prints 3\n",
    "    print(x, y) # prints 1 2\n",

    "    print(\"Hello\", name) # prints Hello Bob\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\" + name) # prints HelloBob\n",
    "    print (\"Hello\" + 5) # Returns TypeError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Naming variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You can name your variables most things. Some things which you can't do are:\n",
    "* Name a variable the same as a keyword (e.g. if, while, for)\n",
    "* Name a variable the same as a data type (e.g. int, float, string)\n",
    "* Name a variable the same as a function (e.g. print, input)\n",
    "* Start a variable name with a number\n",
    "* Use spaces in a variable name\n",
    "* Use special symbols in a variable name (e.g. !, @, #)\n",
    "* Use underscores at the start of a variable name (e.g. _x). You can use them in the middle or end of a variable name (e.g. x_, x_y, x_y_z)\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of valid and invalid variable names are below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1 # valid\n",
    "134 = 1 # invalid\n",
    "x_ = 1 # valid\n",
    "_x = 1 # invalid\n",
    "x y = 1 # invalid\n",
    "x-y = 1 # invalid\n",
    "dhaduafvaf = 1 # valid\n",
    "*&$^%$^%$^% = 1 # invalid\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "### 4.1 Using input()\n",
    "\n",
    "Input is the process of getting information from the user. This is also a very important part of Python, just like outputting data. The main way of getting input from the user is by using the input() function which is really simple. The input() function takes in some data which can be assigned to some variable and then used later on in the program. You can also put a string inside the brackets of the input() function to act as a prompt that is displayed to the user when they can enter an input. Below is an example of inputting data (You can also see we are using everything we have learnt so far as they are core parts of Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    name = input(\"What is your name? \")\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\", name)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Converting data types\n",
    "\n",
    "If anything is inputed into the input() function, then the default result is a string representing their answer. This means that if you want to use the inputted data as a number, you have to convert it to an int or float. This is done by using the int() or float() functions. When you assign the inputted data to a variable, you can put the input() inside the brackets of the int() or float() function. Below is an example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    x = int(input(\"Age: \"))\n",
    "    print(x + 1)\n",

    "    print(int(y) + 1) # This works\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen above, you can convert the variable to a different data type while you are about to use it, such as printing it. This is useful if you want to use the inputted data as a number but don't want to assign it to a specific data type. Also, you could choose to print out the input statement without assigning it to a variable. There is an example of this below.\n",

You may also want to check if two variables are equal to each other, or if one variable is greater than another. Different operators will let you do all of these, assign the answer to some variable and output it if you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Arithmetic operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numbers. The built-in arithmetic operators in Python are really quite basic, meaning taht you should know most of them. Below is a list of the arithmetic operators in Python.\n",
